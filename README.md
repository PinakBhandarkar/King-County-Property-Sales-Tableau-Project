# King-County-Property-Sales-Tableau-Project
1. This project visualizes the property sales in King County, Washington, USA
2. I have considered the condition of the property and co-related it with the view the house provides to create a heat map using the average price as a filter.
3. I have used advanced filters to create an interactive calendar.
4. Users can easily understand complex and large datasets using the dashboard.
5. Relations between house prices and the number of rooms/house conditions/views the house provides are insightful
6. I have used King County Map to create a heatmap using an average price which will highlight darker colors to the regions with the highest prices.
7. This heatmap can be used to analyze how a particular location in the King County Region affects the price of a house
8. The average distribution of number of beds and bathrooms has also been provided in the dashboard for detailed analysis.
9. Helpful for real estate agencies to analyse how price is influenced by location, condition, view, and number of bedrooms.
