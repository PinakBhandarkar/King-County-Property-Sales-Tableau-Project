# King-County-Property-Sales-Tableau-Project
1. This project visualizes the property sales in King County, Washington, USA
2. I have considered the condition of the property and co-related it with the view the house provides to create a heat map using the average price as a filter.
I have used advanced filters to create an interactive calender.
User can easily understand the complex and large dataset using the dashboard.
Relations between house prices and number of rooms / house condition / view the house provides are insightful
I have used King County Map to create a heatmap using average price which will highlight darker colors to the regions with highest prices.
This heatmap can be used to analyze how a particular location in the King County Region affects the price of a house
The average distribution of number of beds and bathrooms has also been provided in the dashboard for detailed analysis.
