# King-County-Property-Sales-Tableau-Project
This project visualizes the property sales in King County, Washington, USA
I have considered the condition of the property and co-related it with the view the house provides to create a heat map using the average price as a filter.
An advanced calendar provides the visualizations according to the given dates
One can also use a filter that uses the year the house was built to provide visualizations
The distributions visualise the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in a house and provide interesting insights into how the number influences the average price
